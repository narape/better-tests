# better-tests

This is a small sample project that can be used to introduce programmers to unit testing with Java. It has the following stuff:

1. A sequence of branches that goes from no-test to junit feature by feature branches to mockito for mocking to test coverage reporting with jacoco
1. Many examples of small, focused unit test cases that validate a single feature.
1. Several examples of stubbing (using the [Apollo StubClient](https://github.com/pettermahlen/apollo/blob/master/apollo-test/src/main/java/com/pettermahlen/apollo/test/StubClient.java))

## branches

The correct way to inspect the branches of this projects is as follows:

1. no-test
1. junit-basics
1. junit-basics-2-before
1. junit-basics-3-exceptions
1. junit-basics-4-hamcrest
1. mockito-basics
1. test-coverage
